# ⚡ Getting Started

## Installation

The installation is as follows:

First, there is a pre-requisite to use [`node`](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 14.20.0 exactly. One can do this by installing the [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) utility and then doing 

```
nvm install 14.20.0
nvm use 14.20.0
```

Users also need to have yarn installed.

Then you can run it by doing:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

To build it:

```
yarn build
```

The app takes the following env variables:

```
REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL="<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_DEPOLOYMENT_URL>/api/v1"
```




## Deployment

We should add a section here as to how its linked to the main ZenML repository

Basically, each ZenML python package comes with the build files (generated by `yarn build`) of a certain version of this dashboard (all build files of the dashboard can be seen in the releases section of this github). Therefore, each ZenML pypi package has bundled in it a corresponding version of this dashboard.

With the python package, you can then serve these static build files by doing:

```
zenml up
```

Which creates a local daemon that serves the files in a FastAPI server!

You can also deploy this dashboard on supported cloud providers with ZenML python package by using the command: 

```
zenml deploy
```
