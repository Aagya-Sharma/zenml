# 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 Meet the Team

![Meet the Team](./assets/community_meetup.png)

Have a question that's too hard to express on our Slack? Is it just too much effort to say everything on a 
long GitHub issue? Or are you just curious about what ZenML has been up to in the past week? 

Well, register now for the ZenML Meet the Community session to get your answers!
It's free and open to everyone.

Every week, the ZenML [core team](https://zenml.io/company#CompanyTeam) will pop in for 30 minutes to interact directly with the community. 
Sometimes we'll be presenting a feature, other times we'll take questions and have fun. 

Join us if you are curious about ZenML, or just want to talk shop about MLOps.

We will host the gathering every Wednesday 8:30AM PT (5:30PM CET). 
Register now through [this link](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zenml-meet-the-community-tickets-354426688767), 
or subscribe to the [public events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y19iaDJ0Zm44ZzdodXBlbnBzaWplY3UwMmNjZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) to get notified 
before every community gathering.
