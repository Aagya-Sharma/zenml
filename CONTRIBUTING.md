### 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it,
please report it right away by sending an
email to: support@zenml.com. Please try to be as explicit as possible,
describing all the steps and example code to
reproduce the security issue.

We will review it thoroughly and get back to you.
